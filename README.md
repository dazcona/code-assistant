## Desc

Conventionally, learning analytics are used to notify students regarding their predicted performance and further resources using email or via a university's Learning Management System. To support students to engage in learning and become more pro-active about their learning, we designed CoderBot. CoderBot, is an Artificial Intelligent Chatbot service deployed on WhatsApp1 as a coding assistant to support learning of computer programming. CoderBot has been deployed in our Universityâ€™s Python Programming I course.
